# Growth - Engineer Challenge

The goal of the challenge is to evaluate your technical skills through a practical demonstration.

---

## üñ• Your Job

Your job is to create a simple full stack application with a special **emphasis on quality**, both in terms of the resulting application and its code.

In the Growth team, we work mostly with `Next.js (React)` and `Ruby on Rails`, but feel free to use the stack you are the most comfortable with.

## üí™ The Challenge

**Your challenge is to build a Frontend + Backend application that allows you to post and visualize metrics in a usable way.**

### Requirements

- Each metric should have, at least: a timestamp, a name and a value.
- The metrics should be persisted in a database.
- The page should allow users to post new metrics.
- The page should contain a line chart in which the metrics are displayed.
- Deploy the application to any hosting service of your choice (Vercel, Heroku, etc.).
- _Nice to have:_ Implement a feature that fits (even if loosely) in the context of the challenge and allows you to showcase your skills and impress us.

The recommended maximum time for the challenge is 8 hours.

Feel free to use any tools you need, but remember to keep your code accessible in a public GitHub repository. If possible, include both the backend and frontend code in the same repository.

Remember to deploy the application to any hosting service of your choice so we can see it working before and during the presentation. For security reasons, we won‚Äôt run the code on our machines.

## üéØ Some Tips

### üí°¬†Don‚Äôt take the statement by heart

The problem statement serves as a starting point for identifying and solving problems. Our team enjoys tackling challenges and delivering innovative solutions. As you work on the tech challenge, keep in mind that the recommended maximum time is only a guideline. You may choose to use more or less time, as long as you are pleased with the outcome.

Success cannot be guaranteed by following a specific recipe. Some people may spend twice the recommended time and still deliver a subpar solution, while others may spend half the time and deliver an excellent one. The most important thing is to produce something that you are proud of.

It's also important to consider scalability and other potential improvements beyond the scope of the challenge. While you don't need to create a perfect application that can be deployed to production right away, it's a good idea to acknowledge any unfinished features and explain why you chose to leave them out of the scope.

### ‚ùì¬†Do not hesitate to ask if you have any doubt

We won't disregard you if you have questions. While we don't want to stifle your creativity, we encourage you to ask questions. As we mentioned earlier, it's important not to take things too personally so feel free to add your own unique touch to the solution. However, your solution should always fulfill the main requisites.

### üëçüèª Good practices

We recommend that the project has a good and clear structure so we can easily navigate it, as well as detailed README covering all the important aspects of the project (it is up to you to define what "important" means üòâ).

You should assume that people from different levels will assess your project, whether you are a junior or a senior developer. Any reviewer will have the chance to dig into your code and extract feedback from it. It is important that you take this into account and assume that we will have zero context about your solution besides the problem statement.

While we view code as a means to an end, we want the journey from problem to solution to be as smooth as possible. This means we won't deliver bad code, and we don't expect you to do so in your challenge.

### ‚≠ê¬† Proof you are a one of a kind

At Factorial, we‚Äôre lucky to get lots of job applications, which gives us the chance to pick out the brightest stars among you. If everyone sent in the same kind of solution just covering the basics, it would make the process boring and make it really hard to find exceptional talent.

As we‚Äôve said, this challenge is a great chance for you to shine and show what makes you unique. Take a moment to reflect on your work and make sure it‚Äôs something you‚Äôd be proud to show off.

## ‚úÖ What we will evaluate

- **Your decision making**: How did you approach each requirement? Which technologies did you choose and why? What did you prioritize? Did the time limit impact these previous decisions?
- **The quality of your solution**: Does the application work? Is it usable? Does it look good? Was there attention to detail?
- **Your ability to write clean code:** Is the code readable, maintainable and easy to extend? Were your practices good?
- **Your communication skills during the interview**: How do you defend your solution and your decisions? How well do you express yourself? How do you explain complex technical concepts?

## üèÉ¬†Next Steps

Once you deliver the challenge, we‚Äôll schedule a second meeting with the rest of the team to evaluate your challenge.

The meeting will have three parts:

1. First, you will be asked to present your project: the resulting application, the code, your decisions during the challenge‚Ä¶ We may interrupt you if we have questions.
2. Once you are finished, we will ask some more questions related to your challenge or the position.
3. Finally, you will be able to ask any question to the team to resolve any doubt you may have.
